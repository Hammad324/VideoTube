**Project Description:**

The concept is to create a comprehensive video hosting API similar to YouTube. It includes user login, signup, video uploading, liking, disliking, commenting, subscribing, unsubscribing, playlist, dashboard, healthcheck and tweet/message functionality. The API will utilize bcrypt for password hashing, multer for file handling, and role-based authentication will be carried out through a middleware. Additionally, Cloudinary will be used for storing images and videos in this project.
