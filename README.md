The idea is to develop a complete video hosting API similar to Youtube with all the features like login, signup, upload video, like, dislike, comment, reply, subscribe, unsubscribe, and many more. It uses bcrypt for password hashing, multer for file handling and authentication is performed via a middleware. I have also used Cloudinary in this project for storing images in specific.
