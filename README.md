**Project Description:**
The concept is to create a comprehensive video hosting API similar to YouTube. It will include user login, signup, video uploading, liking, disliking, commenting, replying, subscribing, unsubscribing, and more. The API will utilize bcrypt for password hashing, multer for file handling, and authentication will be carried out through a middleware. Additionally, Cloudinary will be used for storing images in this project.

**Completed:**
=> Basic setup and settings of the project 
=> Authentication and Authorization, File handling, and uploading the files, specifically images to Cloudinary.
=> User Routes, Controllers.

**Remaining:**
=> liking, disliking a video (controllers are incomplete, the schema is done),
=> subscribing, unsubscribing (controllers are incomplete, the schema is done),
